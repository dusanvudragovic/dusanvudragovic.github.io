    <p>Condensed matter physics and materials science address problems highly relevant for fundamental research, as well as for practical applications and society. The development of high-impact materials with enhanced and engineered properties, or research in quantum information, for example, depend on the results from these areas of physical sciences, and contribute to the IT and smartphone industry, semiconductor technology, energy sector, and many others. Numerical simulations are now indispensible tool in science and technology, and are used to speed up and lower costs if research and development. In the condensed matter physics, scientists deploy a broad range of algorithms, such as solving of nonlinear partial differential equations, classical and quantum Monte Carlo techniques, including solving of Bose-Hubbard and Fermi-Hubbard models, exact diagonalization techniques for strongly correlated systems, etc. Whichever is used, typically it requires large-scale computing resources for simulations of relevant physical systems. Inside the Serbian Condensed Matter Physics Community (CMPC), the most prominent use of computing resources is related to the three applications developed at the national level: SPEEDUP, QSPEEDUP, and GP-SCL. <a href="http://www.scl.rs/papers/CiCP-SPEEDUP.pdf">SPEEDUP code</a> uses Monte Carlo-based path integral algorithm for calculation of quantum mechanical transition amplitudes for 1D models. It is based on the use of higher-order short-time effective actions in the time of propagation (Monte Carlo time step), which substantially improves the convergence of discretized amplitudes to their exact continuum values. <a href="http://www.scl.rs/papers/INFOTEH-2010-A-15.pdf">QSPEEDUP code</a> presents quasi-Monte Carlo extension of the SPEEDUP code. The extended algorithm uses Sobol&#39;s set of quasi-random numbers for generation of trajectories relevant for calculation of transition amplitudes in the path integral formalism. Both applications use identical algorithm, supplied with different random number generators, which allows their unification into a single application designated as (Q)SPEEDUP.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.scl.rs/papers/ComputPhysCommun.183.2021.2012.pdf">GP-SCL</a> is a set of codes parallelized using the OpenMP approach for calculating the dynamics and ground states of quantum fluids (such as Bose-Einstein condensates and superfluids). Quantum fluids represent macroscopic quantum phenomena where large numbers of atoms or molecules behave coherently, allowing special properties to emerge. In the mean-field regime, such systems can be described by a nonlinear Schroedinger equation, usually called Gross-Pitaevskii equation. GP-SCL codes solve the time-(in)dependent Gross-Pitaevskii nonlinear partial differential equation in one, two, and three space dimensions in an arbitrary trapping potential using imaginary-time and real-time propagation. The equation is solved using the semi-implicit split-step Crank-Nicolson method by discretizing space and time, as described <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/0904.3131v4">here</a>. The discretized equation is then propagated in imaginary or real time over small time steps.</p>

<p>Applications are developed by scientists from the <a href="http://www.scl.rs/">Scientific Computing Laboratory</a> of the <a href="http://www.ipb.ac.rs/">Institute of Physics Belgrade</a> and are used by an increasing number of collaborators within Serbia and also from Europe, Brazil, India and China. The applications are deployed on the computing infrastructure provided by the <a href="http://www.aegis.rs/">Academic and Educational Grid Initiative of Serbia</a>, part of the <a href="http://www.egi.eu/">European Grid Infrastructure</a>. To increase the potential user base of the applications, we have decided to create the <a href="http://sci-bus.ipb.ac.rs/">AEGIS CMPC science gateway</a> in the framework of the <a href="http://www.sci-bus.eu/">SCI-BUS project</a>, to provide seamless access to the software and the data generated by the applications. This science gateway also hides the complexity of use of the Grid and applications, which was a barrier for many scientists.</p>
